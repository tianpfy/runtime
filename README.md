                           Cultural heritage in North Queensland

This project explores the cultural heritage of the pastoral industry in North Queensland.
More information about it can be found at (https://stockroute.org/Cattle/).

The following three files comprise


1. deskview.sql - a backup of a POSTGRESQL database of pastoral sites and related features in North Queensland.
The backup was created in pgAdmin4 and it, or the pg_restore command, can be used to restore the database to
your local POSTGRESQL instance. 

The connection url is in the file longacre.properties. This url can be edited by you so that it corresponds to 
your local settings.

Metadata for the database can be viewed at https://thimblemill.com/nqland/stockRoutes.html



2. gulflocale.zip -  a JAVA SWING application built with JAVA 18. This application can be started with 
the following command  'java -jar gulflocale.jar'. The application has data query, GIS analysis and 
map-making utilities for exploring the above database.

The connection url in the file longacre.properties can be set by me so that you can access the database online.
Please e-mail at  j.monaghan@bigpond.com  to get guest login details.
  

   
3. jimjre.zip - a 'customised' Java runtime for running the gulflocale application for those people who do  not
have JAVA already installed locally. 

If you use  this runtime then the command to start the application is  'PATH TO jimjre\bin\java7 -jar PATH TO\gulflocale.jar'

Please email me if you require further help with this step.


regards


Jim Monaghan
